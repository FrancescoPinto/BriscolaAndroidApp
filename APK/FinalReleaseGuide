Here are some observations and info about the work that has been done for the final release.
The final release has been tested multiple times on different real devices and emulators:
	Real Devices:
	- Samsung Galaxy S7 (Nougat)
	- Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (Nougat)
	    (even though no specific code has been written to handle tablet, since I followed some guidelines (e.g. using values-xlarge) the app is enjoyable also on tablets)
	Emulators:
	- Nexus 5X with API 25 and API 26
	- Nexus 10 with API 22
	- Nexus One with API 22
THE CODE EXECUTES CORRECTLY AND WITH NO (DETECTED) BUG, if any problem occurs with the software isntallation, please, contact me.

Most of what has been delivered with the previous release has been left unchanged. The only changes regard the MatchConfig
(that has been generalized to handle partial configurations, e.g. to handle server data).

Regarding the extras:
1) Graphics and sounds:
    - The game has background music and sound fx (can be toggled separately), sounds and music have been obtained using free resources available via web
    - Hope the graphical elements and animations look nice
2) Using a server:
    - It is possible to play online matches human vs. remote
3) AI for H-C games:
    - A random AI is available
    - A pure greedy AI is available (is the DumbGreedy)
    - A slightly better than greedy AI, obtained optimizing the pure greedy AI with some heuristics (is the SmartGreedy)
4) Configurability:
    - The app is available both in italian and english (see values and values-it-rIT folders)
    - It is possible to use two different decks
    - It is possible to toggle music/sound fx
    - It is possible to choose among 3 levels of difficulty (random, dumbGreedy, smartGreedy)
    - It is possible to choose among 3 different velocity levels for animations (REMARK: Very fast has been a perfect way to save time while testing!)
    - It is possible to save an offline match at any time, and load it (and delete the save, if desired)
    - Some statistics are available (list of data about all the played matches, counters about played matches)

ADDITIONAL INFO: 
- Javadoc documentation for all the written Java code is avilable in the Javadoc folder.
- As suggested by the Big Nerd Ranch Guide for Android development, I put drawable resources only for xxhdpi in order to reduce
    the size of the final .apk (as the manual says, the OS will handle downscaling of images. if necessary. without introducing artifacts)
- For the Configurability part, I've added only one more deck to play with. Of course it was possible to add more decks to play with. However,
    I already had difficulties finding (free) image assets for the Minimal Deck (yes, the minimal deck cards are ugly, but I had no choice because
    I'm not an artist so I couldn't draw them by myself...).
- After exchanging an e-mail with Prof. Bernaschina, I decided to solve the "leave" while waiting a match problem in the online game
 by interrupting the started match (this way the player that is matched with the leaving player is not stuck waiting for a player that will never play with him/her)
